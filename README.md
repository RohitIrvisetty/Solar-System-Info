This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

### What I learned

I started this project to practice React, but I soon realized I was writing the same code for every planet, since every page looks the same, and I thought there MUST be a better way. After some research - I found Nextjs. The dynamic paths seem like the solution I was looking for. That also meant a huge refactor of the entire React project.
